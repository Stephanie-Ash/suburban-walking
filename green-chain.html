            <p>The Green Chain Walk is a network of interconnected footpaths covering a distance of 82 Kilometres. It
                was created in 1977 as a way to protect the open spaces of the South-East London area and to prevent
                further building from taking place. The route consists of eleven sections extending from Erith in the
                East to Crystal Palace in the West. It connects the river Thames at the Thames Barrier to the suburbs
                of Bromley and Chislehurst.</p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The route travels through parks, woodlands and other green areas. Although
                there are sections of the route that follow roads, these are infrequent and the majority of the route is
                along off road paths.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                There are many sights to see along the route both natural and historical. These
                include the impressive Art Deco Eltham Palace (pictured), the Victorian dinosaur park of Crystal Palace,
                the Crossness nature reserve and Tarn bird sanctuary.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="walks-info">
            <p>The route is navigated by green signposts (pictured) on streets and at major junctions and by signs on
                solid wooden posts with a yellow arrow on top in woodland or open spaces. The signs are easy to spot and
                located at every turn or deviation from the straight path or where the route may be confusing. When on
                the route there are occasions where there are turnings off the path followed with no signs indicating
                the correct direction. In this situation the straight line path should always be followed. At some
                points the signposts do not point directly down the path to follow, possibly due to being moved, however
                they are close enough that the path to follow is usually clear.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Although the route is never too far from roads or built up areas it can feel isolated in places and
                there are some stretches that clearly do not get regular use. It is not uncommon to walk some sections
                of the route without seeing many other people.

            <p>The eleven sections of the route (listed below) range in distance from 4.2 km to 8.7 km. They generally
                start and end near a public transport link, either bus or rail. A lot of the route is suitable for most
                abilities however, there are some steep sections particularly around Shooters Hill or on route to
                Crystal Palace. The sections are interconnected so can be tackled individually or combined for a longer
                walk
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                A particular favourite of Suburban Walking's is to combine sections 6 and 7 into an 11.5 km curcular
                walk as shown on the map. This route passes the wonderful Eltham Palace, travels through Shepherdleas
                Wood and ventures past the Victorian winter garden of Avery Hill Park. It also visites the Tarn bird
                sanctuary. If feeling nergetic it is well worth venturing a few miles into section 5 before turning back
                to enjoy Oxleas Wood and Meadows (a good coffee stop) and to visit the gothic folly of Severndroog
                Castle which can be climbed for views over the area.
