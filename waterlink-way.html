                <h3>What is it?</h3>
                <p>The Waterlink Way is a walking route and cyclepath extending from South Norwood Coutry Park to the
                    river
                    Thames at Deptford Creek. The route is approximately 8 miles in length and connects Beckenham,
                    Sydenham, Catford, Lewisham and Deptford. The route follows part of the National Cycle Network Route
                    21 which extends between London and the Sussex coast.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The route follows the rivers Pool and Ravensbourne. It generally follows traffic-free paths, shared
                    by cyclists and pedestrians with linking sections of
                    mainly quiet roads in between.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>What will you see?</h3>
                <p>
                    This is very much a river walk. It follows the rivers through a number of lovely parks including
                    South Norwood Country Park, and Ladywell Fields (pictured) where you can stop for a coffee at the
                    Good Hope
                    Cafe. The end of the route is only a step away from the Cutty Sark in historical
                    Greenwich.

                <h3>How do you navigate?</h3>
                <p>The route is navigated by blue National Cycle Network signposts on streets and at major junctions.
                    Through the parks and along the roads between the signposts there are also circular metal way
                    markers set into the pavement.

                <br>
                <h3>Does it feel safe?</h3>
                <p>
                    Although the route is never too far from roads or built up areas it can feel isolated in places and
                    there are some stretches that clearly do not get regular use. It is not uncommon to walk some
                    sections
                    of the route without seeing many other people.

                <h3>What are the route options?</h3>
                <p>The eleven sections of the route range in distance from 4.2 km to 8.7 km. They generally
                    start and end near a public transport link, either bus or rail. A lot of the route is suitable for
                    most
                    abilities however, there are some steep sections particularly around Shooters Hill or on route to
                    Crystal Palace. The sections are interconnected so can be tackled individually or combined for a
                    longer
                    walk.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    A particular favourite of Suburban Walking's is to combine sections 6 and 7 into an 11.5 km curcular
                    walk as shown on the map. This route passes the wonderful Eltham Palace, travels through
                    Shepherdleas
                    Wood and ventures past the Victorian winter garden of Avery Hill Park. It also visites the Tarn bird
                    sanctuary. If feeling nergetic it is well worth venturing a few miles into section 5 before turning
                    back
                    to enjoy Oxleas Wood and Meadows (a good coffee stop) and to visit the gothic folly of Severndroog
                    Castle which can be climbed for views over the area.
