                <h3>What is it?</h3>
                <p>The Waterlink Way is a walking route and cyclepath extending from South Norwood Country Park to the
                    river Thames at Deptford Creek. It is approximately 13 kilometres in length and connects Beckenham,
                    Sydenham, Catford, Lewisham and Deptford. It follows part of the National Cycle Network Route
                    21 which extends between London and the Sussex coast.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    The route follows the rivers Pool and Ravensbourne. It generally follows traffic-free paths, shared
                    by cyclists and pedestrians with linking sections of
                    mainly quiet roads in between.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>What will you see?</h3>
                <p>
                    This is very much a river walk. It follows the rivers through a number of parks including
                    South Norwood Country Park, and the lovely Ladywell Fields (pictured) where you can stop for a
                    coffee at the Good Hope Cafe. The end of the route is only a step away from the Cutty Sark in
                    historical Greenwich.

                <h3>How do you navigate?</h3>
                <p>The route is navigated by blue National Cycle Network signposts on streets and at major junctions.
                    The signs indicate cycle route 21 and generally mention the Waterlink Way by name.
                    Through the parks and along the roads between the signposts there are also circular metal way
                    markers set into the pavement. The signs and markers are easy to spot and are located at every turn
                    or deviation from the straight path or where the route may be confusing.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h3>Does it feel safe?</h3>
                <p>
                    The route is very popular with runners and cyclists particularly in the summer months and it is rare
                    to find yourself alone on the paths. Although the route travels through some more run-down stretches
                    of the rivers, you tend to be close to roads or around people. It is rare to feel isolated on this
                    route.

                <h3>What are the route options?</h3>
                <p>The route runs pretty much in a straight line so there is no real opportunity to make a circular
                    walk. However it passes close to a number of train stations and bus routes so it is possible to walk it in
                    sections if the whole route is not managable. As it follows the rivers most of the route is
                    generally flat and suitable for most abilities.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Suburban walking reccommends a 7.6 km walk from Bromley to Lewisham. The route deviates slightly
                    from the Waterlink Way at the start to allow for a visit to the fantastic Beckenham Place Park containing
                    woodland, a mansion and even a swimming lake. It then travels along the Waterlink Way ending at
                    Lewisham station for easy transport links home. If looking for a slightly longer walk we would
                    definitely reccommend continuing to Greenwich either along the Waterlink Way or across Blackheath
                    from Lewisham.
