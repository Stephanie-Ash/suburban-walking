# Suburban Walking

This is a site providing information on walking routes in the South-East London area. In recent times due to the many lockdowns people have not been able to travel far and have come to rely on and appreciate what their local area has to offer. This site provides information on walking routes in suburban areas that are off the beaten track and feel rural in nature. Some of the routes are quite isolated and are daunting to tackle alone. The site also provides a local walking club so that users can investigate the routes in the company of others.
