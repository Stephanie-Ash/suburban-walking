# Suburban Walking

This is a website providing information on walking routes in the South-East London area. In recent times due to the many lockdowns people have not been able to travel far and have come to rely on and appreciate what their local area has to offer. This website provides information on walking routes in suburban areas that are off the beaten track and feel rural in nature. The site is targeted both towards regular walkers who may normally travel to the countryside and are looking for new route options and new walkers looking to try their first route. Some of the routes are quite isolated and may be daunting to tackle alone. The website also provides a local walking club so that particularly new walkers can investigate the routes in the company of others.

## Features

### Existing Features

* Navigation Bar
    * The navigation bar is found on all pages for easy navigation to the important parts of the site without using the browser navigation buttons.
    * It is identical and in the same location on all pages maing it easy for the user to locate.
    * It is intended that that site will expand over time with additional walking routes added. A summary Routes page is therefore linked to on the navigation bar instead of individual routes to avoid the navigation bar becoming too busy and confusing.

* ### User Stories
  1. As someone new to walking, I want to find clear information about interesting routes with details on how they can be adapted for various abilities.
      * Upon entering the site the user is greeted with a clear homepage with an easily found navigation bar providing quick access to the routes page. The routes page can also be navigated to via the introductory text.
      * The Routes page clearly sets out the routes available and provides easy linked navigation for more information on the selected route.
      * The route description pages are simply laid out with headings describing what each section of text covers. Details of difficulty plus suggested adaptations and a mapped route suggestion are provided along with links to external sites providing more information.
  2. As a female on her own interested in taking up walking for exercise I want to find information about walking routes, but reassurance that I will feel safe.
      * The walking club introduction on the homepage alerts the user to the fact that safety is a consideration of the site. It provides an option they may not have considered giving a reason for future visits to the site.
      * 'Will I feel Safe?' sections are provided on both route pages drawing the user attention to the information they require.

  3. As a regular walker, I want to quickly find information about interesting routes, so that I can try them out. I want to find social media links so that I can keep track of when new routes are added.
      * The navigation features already described allow the user to easily access the information they require.
      * Social media links are found in the footer of every page and will open on a new page allowing the user to navigate to the social media pages.
      * The suggested 'Walk of the Month' on the homepage tells the user that the site is regularly update and gives an incentive for a return visit. The 'Coming Soon' section of the Routes page provides a teaser of what is to come and also provides incentive for a return visit.
